    <p>Our vision of a better world is one where more women are empowered, brave, and confident
         in their abilities. Where we explore other cultures, spend more time in nature, 
         and come to love our world more. Solo traveling is the best thing we've found to promote 
         these qualities. We become the chief architect of our own destiny. 
         Everything is new and our entire surroundings are an opportunity to grow. 
         Our purpose is to provide resources to make traveling more accessible, adventurous, 
         and immersive for you.</p>
    <img src="/images/about.jpeg" alt="About Us" style="float:right;border:5px solid white">
    <p>I'm guessing that you ended up here because, like us, you're looking for the ultimate escape, 
        a chance to get to know yourself better, or you just want to plan an immersive trip that 
        isn't the same thing that everyone else is doing. You want the life-changing experience, 
        the kind that only adventurers have.</p>
    <p>Maybe you're looking for ways to maximize your paid time off, or maybe you're looking 
        to change your life completely, leaving behind the cubicle and embracing an adventure 
        on the other side of the world. Maybe it's something you've wanted your whole life, 
        and nobody around you understands, but your desire for the adventure of a lifetime 
        keeps the dream alive.</p>
    <p>We know that's not easy, and it can be pretty scary to go somewhere you've never been before, 
        especially if you're going it alone.</p>
    <p>Does it sound familiar?</p>   
    <p>We totally get you.</p>
